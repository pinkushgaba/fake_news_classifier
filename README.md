# Final Project. 
## Important Dates 
_All of them are end of day, 23:59:59 local time._

* Accept the assignment by Tuesday, January 31.

* Proposals approved Monday February 6th. 

* The submission date is February 12 (a jupyter notebook in your project repo.)
 
## The scope of a project. 
The scope of a project for this class should involve training or fine-tuning a model for a ML task, using one of the models learned in class (such as RNN, LSTM, or Transformer). You are encouraged to focus on an interesting aspect of the problem, such as comparing different hyperparameters, data preprocessing, or model architectures. The specific problem and model you choose are up to you. The methodology should follow the framework reviewed in class, and the work should be original. You should aim to complete the project within one week of work. You may use datasets from class, or datasets available through Tensorflow or PyTorch, Kaggle, or other resources. In order to earn a perfect score, you are not expected to devise a new model architecture or optimizer, but rather to explore and fine-tune an existing model with hyperparameter tuning, and to be able to explain and present your exploration well in a written form.

## Submission Process and Due Date

### Submission will be in pairs.
When accepting the assignment you will need to join a team or create a team. 

2 students per team. 38 teams total. 

Please pair up!

### Proposal
The proposal should be a file in the repo folder. 
Either a markdown file, like this README, or a markdown cell in a Jupyter notebook. 

### Final submission
The submission deadline for this project is February 12th, 23:59pm. The submission should be made as a Jupyter notebook. Submission will be done via Github Classroom. Late submissions will be penalized by a deduction of 5 points per day (out of 30). Partial days will be rounded up, so for example, a submission received at 12:05 AM on February 14 will result in a 10-point deduction.

## Project Stages 
### Choosing the Problem

For this project, you are encouraged to choose a simple problem that allows for a clear and concise explanation of your results. You may consult with the instructors in advance to discuss your choice of problem. 

### Exposition is Key
In your submission, be sure to include graphs and explanations that help explain your choices and the results of your work. A brief introduction to the problem, the model, and the type of exploration you are conducting will be useful. You are encouraged to include data exploration as part of your submission. Be sure to summarize your findings and highlight the key takeaways from your work. The clarity and depth of your exposition are just as important as the technical aspects of your code, so be sure to spend time on this aspect of your submission.

## Grading

Communication and exposition are important aspects of this project. Therefore, be sure to spend time and effort on clearly stating and explaining your results and your work. 
The grading for this project will be as follows:
* Reasonable and interesting choice of problem: **2 points**
* Clear problem statement: **2 points**
* Technical depth of the code: **15 points**
* Clarity and depth of exposition (including graphs and statements): **10 points**
* Clear summary: **1 point**
